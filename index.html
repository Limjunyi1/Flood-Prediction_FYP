                <h3>About Our Project</h3>
                <p>Our project is at the forefront of innovative flood prediction technology. 
                    Leveraging a custom-built Random Forest model, we harness the power of advanced machine learning to predict flood events with greater accuracy and speed. 
                    We understand the importance of not only predicting but also explaining our predictions. 
                    To achieve this, we integrate SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a cutting-edge Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) tool, 
                    that provides transparency and interprets the decision-making processes of our models. 
                    This approach allows us to pinpoint which features are most influential in predicting flooding, making our system not just a tool for forecasting 
                    but also a platform for understanding and action. Our system is designed to assist policymakers, emergency responders, and communities in making informed decisions 
                    to mitigate the risks associated with extreme weather events, ensuring preparedness and reducing impact.</p>
